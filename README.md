# Model-based-design-of-Embedded-Systems
Model based design of embedded systems and control systems.

Several models of embedded systems and control algorithms. Tested with Simulink verfication and validation tools.

FOC_BLDC_HIL is a model of a control algorithm to commute BLDC motor.
Model contains a control algorithm to commute a BLDC motor with a three-phase sub-cycle averaged inverter with fault detection.

Field Oriented Control (Vector control method) with a three-phase inverter and a BLDC motor.

Plant model (Inverter and BLDC motor) is FPGA compatible model.

Model is tested with MIL then SIL and compatible for HIL testing and verification.
